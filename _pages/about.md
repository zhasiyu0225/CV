<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Siyu Zha, an HCI student researcher passionate about Human-AI Collaboration and Creative Learning. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in Information Art and Design at the Future Lab of Tsinghua University, under the advisory of Prof. [Yingqing Xu](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/yjtd/xyq/index.htm) and now exchange in University of Toronto, under the advisory of Prof. [Jia Xue](https://aij.utoronto.ca/team/dr-jia-xue.html). 

My academic journey began with Educational Technology as an undergraduate and Science and Technology Education as a postgraduate, focusing on exploring how technology can better empower learning and education, and cultivating creative lifelong learners through innovative interdisciplinary content.
She has designed and participated in the LEGO Foundation's COVID-19 Project-Playful Learning Online, the Lifelong Learning Lab's Project X teaching research project, Stanford University's D.school ME310 design thinking course project, Apple's My Coach Forum19 teacher training project, Haidian District Institute's Swift Playgrounds teacher training project, Sony KOOV Science and Innovation Curriculum Design Project, etc. I'm now looking for 2024 summer research opportunities.

[Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16159.pdf)

**Siyu Zha**, Yuehan Qiao, Qingyu Hu, Zhongsheng Li, Jiangtao Gong*, Yingqing Xu
- In submission to the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies (IJHCS).
- TLDR: This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL settings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an exploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five design considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we developed an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional experiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can enhance every stage of PBL. We also discovered ambivalent perspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage. Furthermore, we explored the challenge and design implications of integrating LLMs into PBL and reflected on the program. By bridging AI advancements into educational practice, our work aims to inspire further discourse and investigation into harnessing AI‚Äôs potential in child-centric educational settings.

[Collaborative catalysts: a framework for creative interdisciplinary design workshop](https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1237&context=iasdr)

**Siyu Zha**, Di Zhao*, Meng Li, Wei Gong, Qingyu Hu, Zhongsheng Li
- To appear in the International Association of Societies of Design Research (IASDR),2023.
- TLDR: This study first reviews existing frameworks and the educational factors that affect creativity and productivity; then, it constructs a framework for organizing interdisciplinary workshops to leverage collective creativity through the theme of multi-modal book design for children. Qualitative empirical data was collected and analyzed in accordance with the framework. Finally, we present principles and elements for consideration when conducting an interdisciplinary approach to design experience that fosters creative collaboration by combining inductive and deductive approaches.

[HoloBoard: a Large-format Immersive Teaching Board based on pseudo HoloGraphics]([https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3472749.3474761])

Jiangtao Gong, Teng Han, Siling Guo, Jiannan Li, **Siyu Zha**, Liuxin Zhang, Feng Tian,  Qianying Wang, Yong Rui
- To appear in the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST),2021.
- TLDR: HoloBoard, an interactive large-format pseduo-holographic display system for lecture based classes. With its unique properties of immersive visual display and transparent screen, we designed and implemented a rich set of novel interaction techniques like immersive presentation, role-play, and lecturing behind the scenes that are potentially valuable for lecturing in class.
